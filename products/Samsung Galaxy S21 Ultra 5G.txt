Review;user99;Received the phone today and upon opening it, they include the C cable but don't give you the wall charger to plug it in. My old phone didn't use a C cable so the charger won't work with the new cable. The phone was over $1200 and they can't give you a charger? Now I had to pay an additional $17 for one and I can't use the phone I waited weeks for till the charger arrives next week. Good bye Samsung, nickel and dime someone else cause this will be my last purchase.
Review;user430;What a joke! I am visually impaired and hoped the phone would have more features to help me use it efficiently. As soon as you turn the power on you have to agree to let Google, Samsung and who know who else, track and record everything you do. I can't even use the voice to text feature without allowing Samsung to record my message!? I rely on this feature and Samsung is taking advantage of my disability. Then Google starts streaming unwanted and unsolicited ads that totally interrupt and confuse me as I don't realize I'm reading and ad. If I spend $1000 for a phone I do not expect to lose all of my privacy rights. I'll stick with my old phone.
